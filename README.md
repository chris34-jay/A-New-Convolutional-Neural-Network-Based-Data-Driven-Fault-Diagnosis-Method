# A-New-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Based-Data-Driven-Fault-Diagnosis-Method

In this pape, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features.
The .py file is a implemention of CNN. But I do not provide how to preprocess the dataset.
